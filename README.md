# Text Classification/Sentiment Analysis - A Harvard Capstone Project 
A Text Classification/Sentiment Analysis project using the Amazon Reviews Polarity dataset. 

---  

## Project Overview: Text Classification/Sentiment Analysis  

This project offers an empirical exploration on the use of Neural networks for Text Classification/Sentiment Analysis using the Amazon Reviews Polarity dataset.  

We will cover four network architectures, namely DNN, CNN, sepCNN and BERT.

### Components  

This repository contains the following files:  

1. A report in the form of both a PDF document and an Rmd file.  
2. An Rmd file that I used to perform the machine learning task and create the pdf document.  
3. An R script that can also be used to perform the machine learning task.

### Important: Data set download location 

As Google has changed it's API(atleast I was unable to use it), I had to download the dataset manually from the following URL:    

Please select file named "amazon_review_polarity_csv.tar.gz" and download it to the project directory.  

Download Location URL : [Xiang Zhang Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz8a_Dbh9Qhbfll6bVpmNUtUcFdjYmF2SEpmZUZUcVNiMUw1TWN6RDV3a0JHT3kxLVhVR2M?resourcekey=0-TLwzfR2O-D2aPitmn5o9VQ)  

Once downloaded, the script should take care of the rest.

## Report    

The report documents the analysis and presents the findings, along with supporting statistics and figures. The report includes the following sections:  
1. an introduction/overview/executive summary section that describes the dataset and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed  
2. a methods/analysis section that explains the process and techniques used, including data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, insights gained, and my modeling approach  
3. a results section that presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance  
4. a conclusion section that gives a brief summary of the report, its limitations and future work
